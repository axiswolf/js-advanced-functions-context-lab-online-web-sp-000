 We're giving you this function. Take a look at it, you might see some usage
 that's new and different. That's because we're avoiding a well-known, but
 sneaky bug that we'll cover in the next few lessons!

 As a result, the lessons for this function will pass *and* it will be available
 for you to use if you need it!
